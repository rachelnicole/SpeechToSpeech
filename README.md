# SpeechToSpeech
# Speech to Speech Browser Application

  The application uses IBM's speech recognition, machine translation, and voice synthesis capabilities to instantly translate speech to another language and read the translation aloud.
  
Node.js is used to provide the browser client's authentication token.

[![Deploy to Bluemix](https://bluemix.net/deploy/button.png)](https://bluemix.net/deploy?repository=https://github.com/leonrch/SpeechToSpeech)

## Getting Started

1. Create a Bluemix Account

    [Sign up][sign_up] in Bluemix, or use an existing account. Watson Services in Beta are free to use.

2. Download and install the [Cloud-foundry CLI][cloud_foundry] tool

3. Edit the `manifest.yml` file and change the `<application-name>` to something unique.
  ```none
  applications:
  - services:
    - speech-to-speech-service-standard
    name: <application-name>
    command: node app.js
    path: .
    memory: 256M
  ```
  The name you use will determinate your application url initially, e.g. `<application-name>.mybluemix.net`.

4. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)

5. Install project dependencies and build browser application:
  ```sh
  $ npm install && npm run build
  ```

6. Connect to Bluemix in the command line tool.
  ```sh
  $ cf api https://api.ng.bluemix.net
  $ cf login -u <your user ID>
  ```

7. Create the Speech to Speech service in Bluemix.
  ```sh
  $ cf create-service speech_to_speech standard speech-to-speech-service-standard
  ```

8. Push it live!
  ```sh
  $ cf push
  ```

See the full [Getting Started][getting_started] documentation for more details, including code snippets and references.

## Running locally

  The application uses [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) so you will have to download and install them as part of the steps below.

1. Copy the credentials from your `speech-to-speech-service-standard` service in Bluemix to `app.js`, you can see the credentials using:

    ```sh
    $ cf env <application-name>
    ```
    Example output:
    ```sh
    System-Provided:
    {
    "VCAP_SERVICES": {
      "speech_to_speech": [{
          "credentials": {
            "url": "<url>",
            "password": "<password>",
            "username": "<username>"
          },
        "label": "speech-to-speech",
        "name": "speech-to-speech-service-standard",
        "plan": "standard"
     }]
    }
    }
    ```

    You need to copy `username`, `password` and `url`.

2. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)

3. To install project dependencies, go to the project folder in a terminal and run:
    ```sh
    $ npm install
    ```

4. Then, build the browser application using Browserify:

    * To build with debugging enabled, and rebuild if the app is changed:
    ```sh
    $ npm run watch
    ```
    
    * To simply build the application without debugging or file-change monitoring:
    ```sh
    $ npm run build
    ```

5. Start the application:
    ```sh
    $ node app.js
    ```

6. Go to: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Troubleshooting

To troubleshoot your Bluemix app the main useful source of information are the logs, to see them, run:

  ```sh
  $ cf logs <application-name> --recent
  ```
